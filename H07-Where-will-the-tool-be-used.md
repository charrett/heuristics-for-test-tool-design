Theme: CONTEXT?

Heuristic Question: Where will the tool be used?

## Explanation and subquestions

The location may affect the ability of the person to use the tool. Location may be of the person, of the tool, of co-workers.

Think about: Individuals and teams may be working in different offices, at home, on customer sites, in different countries, in different time zones, behind firewalls, indoors or outdoors, in quiet or noisy environments.

Research Point: We found that people were mandated to use tools that were not available to them because of their location. For example, tool behind a firewall, on different infrastructure, or even access given by job title rather than by need to access the tool. We also found that tools might be available, but not be findable by those who could benefit from them.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- Geography:
    - Are teams working across different physical locations?
    - Have you considered country/cultural differences e.g. character sets, currencies, use of color and symbols, translations?
    - Have you considered writing/reading direction (left to right, right to left, top to bottom)?
- Technical environment:
    - Will the tool work with intermittent or no connectivity (e.g. if used on transport)?
    - What infrastructure / technical environment are different people working on?
    - Is the tool findable?
    - Is it findable in the place people want to use it?
- Physical environment:
    - Is it usable in different physical environments (light and noise levels may affect usability)?


## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand where the tool will be used, you need to understand both its technical environment and the physical location of the people who will use it. Understanding and designing to understand “Where” [is not a trivial challenge](https://www.nngroup.com/news/item/translastion-and-localization-world-tour-stockholm/). 

Activities:
- Revisit the "who" heuristic questions to see if your personas/archetypes need to be strengthened.
- Design a way for people to find the tool and its supporting training materials.
- **Where: geography**
    - [Localization design](https://spotify.design/article/designing-for-the-world-an-introduction-to-localization)
    - Translation design
    - [Cross cultural design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/crosscultural-design/)
- **Where: technical environment**
    - [Service modelling](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/service-design) to understand what technology environments to consider
    - Infrastructure mapping for example against the OSI model
    - [Ecosytem mapping](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ecosystem-maps) to see how the interactions people have with the tool sit within an overall environment
    - Map the organizational locations where the tool might be used to understand how security and firewalls may be needed, or may be blockers to use. 
- **Where: physical environment**
    - Map the physical locations where the tool may be used (inside, outside, challenging locations, etc) to focus on how rugged the tool needs to be

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.
