# H12 How long will the tool be used?
Theme: CONTEXT?

Heuristic Question: How long will the tool be used?

## Explanation and subquestions
This is a different time related question and is about the test tool itself, rather than the product under test.

Think about: 
- the lifespan of the tool. 
    - Will the tool be used enough to gain a return on investment (ROI) in implementing it?  
    - How long will the tool be maintained?
    - How many people will use the tool in that time? 
- the length of time a tool will run continuously without restarting, and therefore the level of reliability required.


Research Point:  We found that:
- a tool with the original purpose of serving a single person or team sometimes starts to be used by other people/teams and requires maintenance long after the original designers/builders stop needing to use it.
- Tools are often acquired and not used (shelfware) – no ROI.
- Tools may need to run continuously for long time periods without restarting.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- How long will we support this tool? What is its expected lifetime?
- How quickly will we get ROI? Is this a short or long term endeavor?
- Will the usage of the tool change over time?
- How long will the tool be maintained for and who will do that maintenance?
- Is this a free tool or a paid-for tool? What investment is required in time/effort to get it implemented and in use, on top of any financial cost – ROI about more than cash
TBC


## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand the ROI required from the tool you need to understand How Long the tool will be used and supported.
By understanding the reliability required from the tool, specifically how long it needs to run, you will be able to design appropriately for Freedom from Risk.



Activities:
- TBD, include ROI calculations.
- TBD need UX activity that will lead to consideration of reliability and maintainability.

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.
Add something on Maintainability of the tests
