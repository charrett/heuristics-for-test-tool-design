# H4 What communication needs or preferences do those people have?

Theme: WHO?

Heuristic Question: What communication needs or preferences do those people have?

## Explanation and subquestions
Different people have different communication styles. The media, speed, level of detail, and other factors change how people want to receive and impart information. Some people have specific accessibility requirements. This is not a binary choice – generally people will fall somewhere on a spectrum for all of these factors, and also their preferences and needs may change in different situations and over time.

Think about:
- Providing choices in level of detail versus overviews, potentially from corporate to management to team and technical levels; the tool may not be directly used, but the data and information flows will be used across organizational levels.
- How communication styles may change (summary versus detailed, direct versus indirect).
- Providing multiple routes, methods and media for information and data sharing.
- Which senses people could use to interact with the tool. This includes both enriching the experience and also improving accessibility.
- Design choices that widen the tool's capability of being used across communication needs.

Research Point: we found that people using test tools have a wide variety of communication styles and preferences.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- have you considered what type of communication people may require depending on their role, their place in the workflow, accessibility needs, persona preferences, level of detail needed, types of decision they are making?
- what level of detail are the people comfortable with and does that change with event, or role? 
- do people need to move between detail and overview?
- how do people prefer to receive and to provide information (e.g. pace of information delivery, e.g. preferred media, e.g. focus on outcome versus focused on people)?
- what different media are required to maximise accessibility?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand Who communicates how you need to understand people’s characteristics, particularly their preferred communication styles. Use the answer to this heuristic question to help you further enrich your personas and your understanding of your stakeholders.

You will need to either understand the specific communication preferences of your specific users, or make generalized personas based on a communication model, for example the DISC profiles.  This is affected by people role/work persona – their behavior in work, rather than their personality,

You also must consider accessibility needs and how those affect the choice of media, input and output options, etc.  You can use the accessibility analysis as a way to improve the communication through the tool for everyone. Accessibility needs may be permanent, situational or temporary. Accessibility needs may be based on sensory, physical, cognitive and emotional states.

Activities: 
-Look at the DISC profile communication preferences either to inform personas, or to carry out DISC profiling;
- Use the Microsoft Inclusive Design Methodology to guide your design process by following their Inclusive 101 guidebook;
- A fun workshop developed by the Accessible Reality team supported by the University of Dundee is the “Pirates” workshop which helps you think about the different types of access needs that a person may have.
- Maybe something here on How Might We questions? TBD

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements for the tool.
