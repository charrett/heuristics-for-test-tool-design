# H2 Who will use of be affected by the tool?

Theme: WHO?

Heuristic Question: Who will use or be affected by the tool?

## Explanation and subquestions

As you identify Why the tool is needed, you might find that different stakeholders have different perceptions of why the tool is required and what it should do: you need to understand Who needs the tool.

Think about:
-	The people/team who have identified/named the problem may not be the person/team who has or needs to solve the problem. 
-	You may be designing this tool for yourself – because you are the person who is going to use it. 
-	In future – tomorrow or next year… - other people may need or want to use it. Who might they be? How might they be different to you? What different needs or ways of working might they have?

Research Point: we found that people using the tools were not always the people who had acquired the tools, and that tooling solutions could be seen as imposed and inappropriate.

Key questions to ask yourself:
-	Who will use the tool?
-	Whose work will change because of the tool?
-	Who provides data to the tool
-	Who uses information from the tool?
-	How will people be affected negatively (e.g. redundancy) or positively (e.g. tedious work removed)?
- Who is paying for the tool?
- 	Who will design, build and maintain the tool?
- 	Who will choose the tool?
-	Is it for you or someone else to use?


## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand who will use or be affected by the tool you need to understand who is a stakeholder. Don’t forget yourself.

You will need to iterate between “Why?” and “Who?” as you identify stakeholders and their goals.

Activities you might find useful to help you understand Who include:
-	Stakeholder Mapping
-	Mapping stakeholders to quality requirements: Quality Value Chain Mapping and Wardley Mapping
-	Onion model: Stakeholders Without Tears and also from Standard ISO 250109
-	Analyzing stakeholders for influence on your work 

Activities to help you understand and model the characteristics of those groups of people include personas and archetypes. With a small number of users you may be able to interview them, and with a large population use sampling, or statistical methods, by using different persona analysis types :
-	Map personas around roles;
-	Map personas around preferences and perspectives; 
-	Map personas around communication and work styles;
-	Persona perspectives may cut across roles;
-	Personas may be more or less broad in scope;
-	You can build usage stories per persona, which can be simple stories or scenarios.
-	empathy maps


Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for the tool.
