Theme: CONTEXT?

Heuristic Question: What work styles are acceptable in those workflows and teams?

## Explanation and subquestions

The organizational culture and team expectations will affect the choices that people have about how they work, how they interact with others, and what support they need from methods and tools to support their work styles.

Think about:
- Level of autonomy individuals and teams have;
- Level of authority managers and leaders have;
- Support to solo, pair and group working;
- How teams are organized.

Research Point: we found that some testers had autonomy to choose their approaches and tools to fit within the wider business workflows, while for other testers the workflow involvement, approaches and tools were mandated by the organization. We found that some testers were frustrated by tools that prevented pair or team working. 

Key questions to ask yourself:
- Are people working solo, paired and/or in groups?
- What level of autonomy do people have over their work approaches?
- TBC
TBD: also relate this back to Freedom from Risk – the domain may dictate the workflow, approaches, tools.
Also relate this to Flexibility -. Work in situations with high level of autonomy to change approaches and tools.


## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand what styles of working the tool must support, you will need to how the cultural context of the organization affects how people are enabled or blocked from taking different approaches.



Activities:
- TBD (I have some materials I developed on team shape – to be uploaded in a usable format – activities to identify team shapes that occur in different levels of manager authority and team autonomy)
- TBD – activities to understand where the workflow intersects activities that require testing tasks, and potentially are supported by tools

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.
