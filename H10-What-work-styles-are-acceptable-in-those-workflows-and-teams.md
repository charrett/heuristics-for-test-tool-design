Heuristic Question: What work styles are acceptable in those workflows and teams?

## Explanation and subquestions

The organizational culture and team expectations will affect the choices that people have about how they work, how they interact with others, and what support they need from methods and tools to support their work styles.

Think about:
- Level of autonomy individuals and teams have;
- Level of authority managers and leaders have;
- Support to solo, pair and group working;
- How teams are organized.

Research Point: we found that some testers had autonomy to choose their approaches and tools to fit within the wider business workflows, while for other testers the workflow involvement, approaches and tools were mandated by the organization. We found that some testers were frustrated by tools that prevented pair or team working. 

Key questions to ask yourself:
- Are people working solo, paired and/or in groups?
- What level of autonomy do people have over their work approaches?
- TBC

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand how to address risk appropriately in your design choices, you will need to understand the stakeholders’ attitudes to risks.


Activities:
- Risk identification and assessment with Stakeholders;
- Domain identification;
- Identify what testing of the tool is appropriate;
- Use humanity-centered design processes.


Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for the tool.

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.


NB: add point that the Environmental risk mitigation and the Health and Safety mitigation are both covered in humanity-centered design.
Note from Reviewer: Do we distinguish the difference between the risks of the tools themselves and the risk of the workflows the tools are used in?
