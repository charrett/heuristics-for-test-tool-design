Heuristic Question: What work styles are acceptable in those workflows and teams?

## Explanation and subquestions

The organizational culture and team expectations will affect the choices that people have about how they work, how they interact with others, and what support they need from methods and tools to support their work styles.

Think about:
- Level of autonomy individuals and teams have;
- Level of authority managers and leaders have;
- Support to solo, pair and group working;
- How teams are organized;
- Level of confidence that teams have in their process. This might include maturity, assurance, experience level, support to grow that experiences/skills.

Research Point: we found that some testers had autonomy to choose their approaches and tools to fit within the wider business workflows, while for other testers the workflow involvement, approaches and tools were mandated by the organization. We found that some testers were frustrated by tools that prevented pair or team working. We found that use of pattern-matching and visualization increased with expertise.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- Are people working solo, paired and/or in groups?
- What level of autonomy do people have over their work approaches?
- How assured the testers are in their process?
- How assured are the owners of related processes?
- How easy are they in their usage, what evidence is there of that?
- How they feel about it, how confident for example?
- What support you can give via the tool to increase confidence?
   
Relate this back to [H09](H09-What-risks-are-associated-with-those-workflows.md); the domain risks may dictate the workflow, approaches, tools, and the level of autonomy people have to choose and change their workflows. In work situations with a high level of autonomy to change approaches and tools, flexibility in the tool workflows will be important. In other work places, a low level of flexibility is appropriate.


## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand what styles of working the tool must support, you will need to how the cultural context of the organization affects how people are enabled or blocked from taking different approaches.

Activities:
- A [map of team autonomy versus organizational authority](https://leadership.org.au/) gives two dimensions to understand work styles that may be needed. For example, if teams are working collaboratively, then a tool would need to support multiple people beign assigned to a task.
- Adding a third dimension to the map from [H09 - domain and workflow risk](H09-What-risks-are-associated-with-those-workflows.md) - could provide a rationale for how rigidly enforced or tailorable the workflows are.

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.
