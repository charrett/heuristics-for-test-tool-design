Theme: WHO?

Heuristic Question: Who will use or be affected by the tool?

## Explanation and subquestions

This heuristic is important because we found a broad and non-stereotypical group of people are testing, and therefore may be using the tool. You will also have stakeholders who may not use the tool, but may influence the goals for the tool. 
As you identify *Why* the tool is needed, you might find that different stakeholders have different perceptions of why the tool is required and what it should do: you need to understand *Who* needs the tool.

Think about:
-	The people/team who have identified/named the problem may not be the person/team who has or needs to solve the problem. 
-	You may be designing this tool for yourself – because you are the person who is going to use it. 
-	In future – tomorrow or next year… - other people may need or want to use it. Who might they be? How might they be different to you? What different needs or ways of working might they have?

Research Point: we found that people using the tools were not always the people who had acquired the tools, and that tooling solutions could be seen as imposed and inappropriate.

Key questions to ask yourself:
-	Who will use the tool?
-	Whose work will change because of the tool?
-	Who provides data to the tool
-	Who uses information from the tool?
-	How will people be affected negatively (e.g. redundancy) or positively (e.g. tedious work removed)?
- Who is paying for the tool?
- 	Who will design, build and maintain the tool?
- 	Who will choose the tool?
-	Is it for you or someone else to use?


## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand who will use or be affected by the tool you need to understand who is a stakeholder. Don’t forget yourself.

You will need to iterate between “Why?” and “Who?” as you identify stakeholders and their goals.

Activities you might find useful to help you understand *Who* include:
-	[Stakeholder Mapping](Technique-Stakeholder-Mapping.md) which includes simple mapping onto a matrix, the onion model, value chain modelling and Wardley Mapping.

When you have a small number of people to understand, you may be able to interview them. With a large population, you can use sampling, or statistical methods. You can model this with activities to help you understand and model the *characteristics* of those groups of people include mapping:
- [personas and archetypes](Technique-Personas-and-Archetypes.md).

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for the tool.
