# Heuristics for Test Tool Design
_Developed by: [Isabel Evans](mailto:isabel.evans.17@um.edu.mt) - University of Malta_

These 12 heuristic questions are intended to provoke thought and ideas when designing or choosing a test tool. Elsewhere in this repository are explanations and action lists for each heuristic, plus background to the research. As I have data to add (and as I work out how to do things) I will update things... Meantime, keeping it simple.

## Summary list of heuristic questions
1. [Why do we need this tool?](H01-why-do-we-need-this-tool.md)
2. [Who will use or be affected by the tool?](H02-Who-will-use-or-be-affected-by-this-tool.md)
3. [What previous experiences do people bring to the tool](H03-What-previous-experiences-do-people-bring-to-the-tool.md)
4. [What communication needs or preferences do those people have?](H04-What-communication-needs-or-preferences-do-those-people-have.md)
5. [What learning perspectives and goals do those people bring?](H05-What-learning-perspectives-and-goals-do-those-people-bring.md)
6. [What learning preferences do those people have?](H06-What-learning-preferences-do-those-people-have.md)
7. [Where will the tool be used?](H07-Where-will-the-tool-be-used.md)
8. [What workflows will the tool be part of?](H08-What-workflows-will-the-tool-be-part-of.md)
9. [What risks are associated with those workflows?](H09-What-risks-are-associated-with-those-workflows.md)
10. [What work styles are acceptable in those workflows and teams?](H10-What-work-styles-are-acceptable-in-those-workflows-and-teams.md)
11. [When will the tool be used?](H11-When-will-the-tool-be-used.md)
12. [How long will the tool be used?](H12-How-long-will-the-tool-be-used.md)


These questions deliberately have multiple interpretations and a myriad of answers. They are intended to help you to think widely and come up with ideas to consider, who to involve, questions to ask. There are no right answers â€“ by asking the questions and following the corresponding activities, you will find interpretations and answers for your context.

Each question will be linked to an explanation, with things to think about, research points and evidence from industry contributors, key questions to ask yourself, activities to help you answer the questions, plus pointers to quality attributes to consider in your specific context. Further levels of detail will be linked in - ongoing. [Information on how to use the heuristics to be added - placeholder](how-to-use-the-heuristics.md).

![Flowchart showing navigation around the repository. From this README file, you can find links to each heuristic, information on how to use the heuristics, the repository licence, and information about the research and the reseachers. From each heuristic description you will find links to techniquues to answer the heuristic question, plus tester and context characteristics derived from the research, and quality in use attributes. At various points in the repository you will find links to information on webpages outside this repository.][h-flow1](h-flow1.jpg)

The heuristic questions and explanations are grounded in research data collected from surveys, workshops, interviews, and industry and academic literature in the period 2018-2023. They have been developed iteratively through a series of reviews with UX, accessibility, and testing industry experts and practitioners. This process is ongoing. [Find out more about the research and the researcher](About-the-research-and-researcher.md).

NOTE: both the heuristics and the underlying explanations and activities are still draft. They are being developed in an iterative process which is looking at the content and the format of the materials. Example activities and links to further information are indicative, and to be replaced later. Format and medium will change. American spellings have been adopted.
