Theme: WHO?

Heuristic Question: What learning preferences do those people have?

## Explanation and subquestions

Depending on the person and their preferences a mix of media and teaching methods may be needed in the learning materials.

Think about: 
- Providing learning materials as video, audio, text, pictorial/diagrams.
- Providing learning materials for both solo and team learning.
- Providing learning materials for practical and theoretical styles of learning.
- Online versus face to face learning
- Provide “short burst” and extended learning opportunities.

Research Point: we found that people expressed a range of preferences for how to learn – for example whether solo or in pairs, prefer media, whether guided or exploratory AND that these did not necessarily match with their general problem-solving preferences. We also found that people had very little time allowed for learning and development.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- have you considered solo and group learning routes?
- have you considered what mix of theory, practice, guided and exploratory learning is appropriate?
- have you considered learning and help materials in different media?
- have you considered both face to face and remote learning?
- have you considered how mentoring, coaching, listening and doing might be included?
- have you considered how self-help learning might be used?
- have you considered how to train the trainers, coaches and mentors?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand *Who learns how* you need to understand their different learning preferences.  

Some people prefer solo and group/pair learning.  People will need theory, practice, exploring, and guided learning. People may have preferences or needs for different media.

We have tabulated the [Quality in Use and Product Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md) in a priority order based on the input from industry practitioners during our research. Use that data to help you focus on the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for your tool. We've included quotes from practitioners that you can use to help you understand your own goals, stakeholders, and contexts, plus a cross reference between the heuristics and the quality attributes. **These may help wth persona development.**

Other Activities: 
- Use what you have discovered about [communication styles in H04](H04-What-comunication-needs or preferences-do-those-people-have.md) to inform both the media and the formats in which you supply learning materials.
- If you have not worked with learning preferences, here is an article which may help you enrich your persona definition with [learning preferences](https://cultivatedmanagement.com/two-learning-styles/).
