Theme: CONTEXT?

Heuristic Question: When will the tool be used?

## Explanation and subquestions
Time factors both for the product under test and for the tool itself affect the tool design.

Think about: The workflow may take an extended time, or be done in stages with time gaps. The workflow may take place through different lifecycle stages of a product under test, and therefore some activities’ urgency may change, risks may change, perceptions of quality may change. Defects may need to be managed differently in the early stages of a product lifecycle (during prototyping for example) compared with defect management during mainstream of product development. There may be a different urgency as deployment approaches, or when in support as a live product.

Research Point: we found that participants were frustrated by tools slowing down their work. We found participants with accessibility requirements could be slowed or blocked by the test tool not playing well with the assistive technology.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- When during the product lifetime (PL) and during the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the tool used?
- What urgency is there to the tasks the tool supports – and does that change across the SDLC and PL?
- Are tasks supported by the tool contiguous or broken with time gaps in the workflow?
- Are there external time factors that affect time/dates?
- What time are people allowed by their organizations to complete their tasks, and how can the tool be designed to support that?
- Do some people need longer to complete tasks perhaps because of accessibility requirements and use of assistive technology to engage with the tool?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand When the tool might be used, and how you design to support time related requirements, you will need to TBD



Activities:
- TBD – PERT charting to understand workflow dependencies and slack/critical path? Understanding that some activities are on the critical path (test activities often are) and there is no slack for those.
- TBD – journey mapping to describe activities over time
- TBD need UX activities that will lead to maintainability (of the tests, test artefacts, related artefacts)

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.
