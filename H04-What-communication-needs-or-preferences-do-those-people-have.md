Heuristic Question: What communication needs or preferences do those people have?

## Explanation and subquestions
This heuristic is used to add depth to your findings from H02 and H03. 
Different people have different communication styles. The media, speed, level of detail, and other factors change how people want to receive and impart information. Some people have specific accessibility requirements. This is not a binary choice – generally people will fall somewhere on a spectrum for all of these factors, and also their preferences and needs may change in different situations and over time.

Think about:
- Providing choices in level of detail versus overviews, potentially from corporate to management to team and technical levels; the tool may not be directly used, but the data and information flows will be used across organizational levels.
- How communication styles may change (summary versus detailed, direct versus indirect).
- Providing multiple routes, methods and media for information and data sharing.
- Which senses people could use to interact with the tool. This includes both enriching the experience and also improving accessibility.
- Design choices that widen the tool's capability of being used across communication needs.

Research Point: we found that people using test tools have a wide variety of communication styles and preferences. For example, 
- people with more experience and expertise used visualisation, with visual representations of information and concepts than less experienced people (this fits with work done by other researchers on other IT roles).
- people varied in whether they wanted details or summaries/overviews of data, and this did not fit to experience level.
- people vaired in how much they wanted to work alone and how much with others. 

Key questions to ask yourself:
- have you considered what type of communication people may require depending on their role, their place in the workflow, accessibility needs, persona preferences, level of detail needed, types of decision they are making?
- what level of detail are the people comfortable with and does that change with event, or role? 
- do people need to move between detail and overview?
- how do people prefer to receive and to provide information (e.g. pace of information delivery, e.g. preferred media, e.g. focus on outcome versus focused on people)?
- what different media are required to maximise accessibility?

### Accessibility

Disabilities can be permanent, temporary or situational. They can be physical, cognitive, learning, neurological, apply to any of the senses.
International and government bodies have standards, laws, guidelines and guidance materials.

### Communication styles

The DISC profiling method identifies communication styles in four quandrants: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Compliance. Each one indicates a pace of communication and how people oriented or otherwise
We are all a mix of these.
- "D" is fast moving and results driven - dashboard?
- "I" is outgoing, people oriented - DM, interactive, group tool?
- "S" likes structure, consistency and a steady pace - form based tool?
- "C" likes facts, data, precision, order - spreadsheet?

People are divided among these profiles. Looking at people's hobbies as a proxy for their communication styles we found a wide mix of people testing: team and solo, practical and analytical, reserved and communicative. 
You could use the DISC to provide a set of communication characteristics towards your personas.

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand *Who communicates how* you need to understand people’s characteristics, particularly their preferred communication styles. Use the answer to this heuristic question to help you further enrich your personas and your understanding of your stakeholders.

You will need to either understand the specific communication preferences of your specific users, or make generalized personas based on a communication model, for example the DISC profiles.  This is affected by people role/work persona – their behavior in work, rather than their personality. 

You also must consider accessibility needs and how those affect the choice of media, input and output options, etc.  You can use the accessibility analysis as a way to improve the communication through the tool for everyone. Accessibility needs may be permanent, situational or temporary. Accessibility needs may be based on sensory, physical, cognitive and emotional states.

To help you with these activities here are links to some expternal sites with "how to" information: 
- Look at the [DISC profile communication preferences](https://tonyrobbins.com/disc/) either to inform personas, or to carry out DISC profiling - not to run a profile on everyone, but to think about the different communication needs and preferences shown in that model;
- Use the [Microsoft Inclusive Design Methodology](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/) to guide your design process by following their [Inclusive 101 guidebook](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf);
- A fun workshop developed by the [Accessible Reality](http://accessible-reality.org/) team supported by the University of Dundee is the “Pirates” workshop which helps you think about the different types of access needs that a person may have.

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements for the tool.
