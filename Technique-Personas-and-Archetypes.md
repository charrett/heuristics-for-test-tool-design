## Description

TBC: study people working in context to understand what they do and why.

These activities help you understand and model the characteristics of the groups of people who will use the proposed tool. 
Two techniques you could use are personas and archetypes. 

[Personas](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them)
[Archetypes](https://radinadoneva.medium.com/behavioural-archetypes-instead-of-personas-c7ccc5b8b998) 

With a small number of users you may be able to interview them all. 
With a large population you need to use a method that helps you understand groups that represent your users. 

[NNGroup have a really useful summary with links to many ways of building personas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-study-guide/)
You can:
-	Map personas around roles;
-	Map personas around preferences and perspectives; 
-	Map personas around communication and work styles;
-	Persona perspectives may cut across roles;
-	[Personas may be more or less broad in scope](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona-scope/);
- Sampling, or statistical methods

You can build usage stories per persona, which can be [simple stories](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-stories) or [scenarios](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-scenarios).

You can build [empathy maps](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/10-tips-develop-better-empathy-maps/)
