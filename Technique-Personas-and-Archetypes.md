## Description

Personas and archetypes help you understand and model the characteristics of the groups of people who will use the proposed tool. 
With a small number of users you may be able to interview them all. 
With a large population you need to use a method that helps you understand groups that represent your users. 
Two techniques you could use are personas and archetypes. 

[Personas](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them)

[Archetypes](https://radinadoneva.medium.com/behavioural-archetypes-instead-of-personas-c7ccc5b8b998) 

[NNGroup have a really useful summary with links to many ways of building personas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-study-guide/)

You can:
-	Map personas around roles;
-	Map personas around preferences and perspectives; 
-	Map personas around communication and work styles;
    -	NB: Perspectives, preferences and styles may cut across roles rather than align with them;
-	[Personas may be more or less broad in scope](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona-scope/);
- Use sampling, or statistical methods based on usage data if this is an existing tool with analystics collected.

Heuristics H03 to H12 help you add details to the characteristics of the personas, and understand their contexts.

Having got your personas or archtypes, you can build usage stories per persona, which can be [simple stories](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-stories) or [scenarios](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-scenarios) and you can build [empathy maps](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/10-tips-develop-better-empathy-maps/).

## Rationale
### Research evidence
We found that people testing are a much wider and more heterogenous group than meets stereotypes for IT workers. We found that tools often were designed for a more narrow and stereotypical group.

### When to use this technique
Unless you have a small number of specific people using the tool, it will **always** be useful to make groupings by persona or archetype to help you identify the range of preferences, perspectives, styles and characteristics that people using the tool may have.

### Advantages
Gain a better understanding of people who will use the toool, while managing that in a small number of representative groups, rather than a myriad of individuals.

### Disadvantages
Takes time to do well.
