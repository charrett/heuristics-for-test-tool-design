# Personas and Archetypes

## Description

Personas and archetypes help you understand and model the characteristics of the groups of people who will use the proposed tool. 
With a small number of users you may be able to interview them all. 
With a large population you need to use a method that helps you understand groups that represent your users. 
Two techniques you could use are personas and archetypes. 

You can:
-	Map personas around roles;
-	Map personas around preferences and perspectives; 
-	Map personas around communication and work styles;
    -	NB: Perspectives, preferences and styles may cut across roles rather than align with them;
-	Use sampling, or statistical methods based on usage data if this is an existing tool with analytics collected.

Heuristics [H03 to H12](README.md) help you add details to the characteristics of the personas, and understand their contexts.
The [Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md) information will help you enrich the personas.

## Rationale
### Research evidence
We found that people testing are a much wider and more heterogenous group than meets stereotypes for IT workers. We found that tools often were designed for a more narrow and stereotypical group.

To add to your personas, we have added quotes and other research points to each of the heuristics' explanations - Use these ideas as a "pick and mix" menu, for example:
- educational background: most of the people who took part had degree or postgraduate qualifications
    - but 16% did not has a degree
    - and although some of those with degrees had a software engineering qualification, many did not - degrees included arts, humanities, sciences
    - **Suggestion** include different educational backgrounds in your personas, and don't assume IT or software knowledge
- work background: many of our participants had previously worked in non IT roles, sometimes in the domain for the software under test, sometimes not
    - **Suggestion** include different work experiences in your personas
- learning preferences: different participants had different preferences for how to learn
    - **Suggestion**  include solo versus group learning and problem solving preferences, include preferences for different media based on communication styles, use the examples in the heuristics to add to the personas.


### When to use this technique
Unless you have a small number of specific people using the tool, it will **always** be useful to make groupings by persona or archetype to help you identify the range of preferences, perspectives, styles and characteristics that people using the tool may have.

### Advantages
Gain a better understanding of people who will use the tool, while managing that in a small number of representative groups, rather than a myriad of individuals.

### Disadvantages
Takes time to do well.

[NNGroup have a really useful summary with links to many ways of building personas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-study-guide/)

[Personas may be more or less broad in scope](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona-scope/)

Having got your personas or archetypes, you can build usage stories per persona, which can be [simple stories](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-stories) or [scenarios](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-scenarios) and you can build [empathy maps](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/10-tips-develop-better-empathy-maps/).
