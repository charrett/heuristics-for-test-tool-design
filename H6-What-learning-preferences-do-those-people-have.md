Theme: WHO?

Heuristic Question: What learning preferences do those people have?

## Explanation and subquestions

Depending on the person and their preferences a mix of media and teaching methods may be needed in the learning materials.

Think about: 
- Providing learning materials as video, audio, text, pictorial/diagrams.
- Providing learning materials for both solo and team learning.
- Providing learning materials for practical and theoretical styles of learning.
- Online versus  face to face learning
- Provide “short burst” and extended learning opportunities.

Research Point: we found that people expressed a range of preferences for how to learn – for example whether solo or in pairs, prefer media, whether guided or exploratory AND that these did not necessarily match with their general problem-solving preferences. We also found that people had very little time allowed for learning and development.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- have you considered solo and group learning routes?
- have you considered what mix of theory, practice, guided and exploratory learning is appropriate?
- have you considered learning and help materials in different media?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand Who learns How you need to understand their different learning preferences.  

Some people prefer solo and group/pair learning.  People will need theory, practice, exploring, and guided learning. People may have preferences or needs for different media.

Activities: 
- Use what you have discovered about communication styles to inform both the media and the formats in which you supply learning materials.
- Enrich your persona definition with learning preferences.

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements for the tool.
Tbd based on reviewer note:  would also expect mentoring, coaching, intervision, and more of those people-to-people interaction styles that contribute to learning.
