# How to use the heuristics

This section tells you about different ways to use the heuristics in different situations.

## Overview - generic use

### Navigating the Heuristic Explanations
Each Heuristic has a page with an overview explanation of the heuristic, the research evidence, and activities. You will find on each heuristics page:

- **Theme:** the heuristics are divided into three themes: *Why* do we need the tool? *Who* will use it? and *Context* the tool will be used in? - 
- **Heuristic question:** just to remind you where you are.
- **Explanation and subquestions:** provides you with some points to think about, and key questions to ask yourself. Also in this section, a finding from our research that supports this heuristic and a link to some research quotes and characteristics that will help you ground your understanding and decisions.
- **Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions:** A menu of useful techniques, linked to further information either within this repository or on the internet. 

### You can tailor this to suit you
Don't be limited by the questions or the activities list - you don't have to do them all, and you may have preferred alternatives.

If you want to tailor the heuristics to suit your context, please do - see the [licence](LICENSE) to see how to do that and remember to reshare your versions and tailoring.

The sections below show some ways to use the heuristics: 
- if you are designing a tool to be used by you or your team in-;
- if you are a tool vendor designing or building a test tool;
- if you are designing or building an open-source test tool;
- if you are using the heuristics to help you choose or evaluate a test tool.

## I'm designing or building test tools to be used in-house

You probably know *why* you want to build this tool, possibly with yourself in mind as the primary person using the tool, but have you thought carefully about *who else* might want to use it and why they might want to use it?
It could be *anyone in the organization* which might be too hard to think about, so instead we use personas or archetypes to help us think about groups of people, and the different contexts in which they will use the tool.
