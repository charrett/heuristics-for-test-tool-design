Theme: WHO?

Heuristic Question: What previous experiences do people bring to the tool?

## Explanation and subquestions
As you identify *Who* you will need to drill down into their characteristics; thinking about previous experiences will help you focus on understanding expectations and skill levels.

Think about: 
- Other people will have a different background or experiences to you, that may lead them to have a different understanding of how to carry out the work, the choices they want to make, and the support they require. 
- This includes previous experience with the domain, the software under test, IT, testing, test tools and this specific tool. 
- These experiences will affect their preconceptions of how to engage with the tool: what it does, and how they want to engage with it.

Research Point: we found that people testing software came from a wide range of backgrounds, with widely differing experiences of domains, IT, testing and tools.
It is difficult to design tools for a wide range of people, but it is possible to make a tool useable by as many groups of people as possible. Think about who else needs to use the tool.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- How will you enable people to work effectively and efficiently who bring different backgrounds, skills and experiences to the tool? 
- Will something that feels obvious and intuitive to you be as obvious and intuitive to others? What would be obvious and intuitive to other people?
- How can your design include others – how will you [design in accessibility, inclusion](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/)?
- What is your expectation of experience and skill levels and does that match the actual skills and experience people have? (May be lower or higher than yours… Are you over-estimating or under-estimating people’s knowledge and skill?)
- Have previous experiences with new tools or new methods been supportive to the person? This might include [whether a learning culture is encouraged](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qz43x) and [understanding the developer experience](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3639443): both those links are to work about developers, but the same questions arise for testers.

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand Who you need to know not just the roles but also people’s characteristics. Use the answers to this heuristic question to help you enrich your persona groups that you started when anwering heuristic [H02](H02-Who-will-use-or-be-affected-by-this-tool.md).

You need to understand the pre-existing knowledge people bring to the tool so you provide an appropriate experience to them, for example by including both introductory steps for beginners and short cuts for more experienced people.

Activities:
-	Add to your Persona design, including [different types of persona](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them);
-	Do a skills gap analysis thinking about your personas as [learner personas](https://corporate.britishcouncil.org/insights/evolving-role-learner-personas).

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements for the tool.
