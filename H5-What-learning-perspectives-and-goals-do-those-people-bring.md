# H5 What learning perspectives and goals do those people bring?
Theme: WHO?

Heuristic Question: What learning perspectives or goals do those people bring?

## Explanation and subquestions
Depending on the person and the organizational goals people may want to only learn enough to enable them to complete a specific task, or they may want to learn enough to enable expertise/mastery of a role/activity. This may be affected both by personal choice and by organizational pressure.
Think about: 
- what long and short-term goals people have with the tool – specifically about learning to use the tool
- what types of training material are required and how you cover different personas and perspectives.
Research Point: we found that managers we interviewed had the goal of people learning just enough and coming “up to speed” and complete specific tasks. We found that test practitioners ranged in goals from task-based fast learning to wishing to study to get mastery of a tool. “we live in a world where people have very little time to learn how to do things”

Key questions to ask yourself:
- are people more focused on the task in hand or moving to the big picture?
- are people interested in initiating improvements (self/workflow/organization)?
- do people want to complete current tasks or more interested in becoming experts/mastering work?
- have you considered the contexts for learning e.g. time available, inhibitors and enablers for learning, task specific or mastering tool/workflow?
- have you considered accessibility and availability of the learning materials?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand Who learns how you need to understand their different constraints, and different learning goals. People will have constraints on learning time, what media they can use, on their goals for learning.

Differentiate between people’s goals for mastery of a subject – which might include mastering the theory, with their need to solve a problem right now, which is likely to be task-based.

Activities: 
- understanding your stakeholders’ expectations for the training budget (cost and time spent) will help you understand constraints. Revisit stakeholders’ goals.
- Set learning outcomes for your training material that are clear and appropriate for different personas.

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements for the tool.
