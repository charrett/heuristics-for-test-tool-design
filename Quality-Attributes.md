# Quality Attributes

## What are quality attributes?
Quality attributes are properties of a product which affect how well the product performs. Generally a software system but it could be some other product or service.  
Some of these are Quality in Use Attributes: they refer to attributes that are a measure of how good the experience is of using the product. They include the effectiveness with which someone can carry out their task, their safety, the flexibility with which they can work. 
Others are technical or product attributes which are built into the product and which the building blocks contributing to how the quality in use is achieved. They include functionality, usability, performance, security, and many others.  

NB: even as I write this, new standards are being developed, published, and discussed meaning there are several ways of dividing up the quality in use and product quality attributes. 
On this page, I am going to provide a simplified summary of some of the main quality attributes, plus notes from the research data. 
You can of course go to buy the new standard, [ISO 25019](https://www.iso.org/standard/78177.html) which has different definitions.
Or use this summary from TMAP of the previous version ISO 25010 with their additional definitions have added for AI and sustainability [Summary of ISO 20510 from TMAP with links to additional attributes](https://www.tmap.net/wiki/quality-characteristics). 

## Quality Attributes in the research data
What makes a tool successful is definitely not just its functionality and technical attributes. Hereâ€™s some data from the research, also summarised in Table 1:

- 98% of the participants mentioned usability and quality in use of the tools as a concern, issue, or necessity.
- 90% of the participants mentioned management and organizational issues as a concern, issue, and support being necessary.
- 91% of the participants mentioned other attributes including functionality.

**Table 1: Themes: Organisational, Technical, Usability**
|Theme                        |	Participants   | Frequency |
|:----------------------------|:--------------:|:---------:|
| Organisational Management   |101 (90.9%)     |377 (27.8%)|
| Technical Attributes        |102 (91.8%)     |466 (34.4%)|
| Quality in Use / Usability  |109 (98.2%)     |563 (41.6% |

## Usability, Quality in Use, and the User Experience

Quality in Use (QiU) and Usability had the most frequent mentions in our data. 
Understanding how the different attributes are building blocks to the overall user experience (UX) helps us to design in a better UX, shown in the flowchart below. 
A good User Interface (UI) is supported by interaction design, and contributes to usability, which also includes designing for the users' efficiency, effectiveness, support to meet their goals in their context. 
Usability is one contributor to quality in use, which also includes flexibility in use and freedom from risk. 
QiU is also supported by all the technical attributes, such as maintainability, performance, security. 
QiU contributes to UX, and design should address trust, credibility, flow through tasks and the usefulness of the product. 
All of this, influenced by past experiences, mantal models and personal circumstances leads to the lived experience, and gives rise to emotions.

Table 2 lists the QiU attributes with a comment for reach on sub attributes and some questions to ask yourself when designing the tool.

**Table 2: Quality in Use Attributes**
|Attribute         | Comment |
|:-----------------|:--------|
|Effectiveness     |When someone is carrying out a task, using the testing tool, how well does it support them to carry out the task confidently, so they know they have not made mistakes, and know they are achieving what they want to achieve, accurately and completely?|
|Efficiency        |When someone is carrying out a task, using the testing tool, how much effort does it take them to carry out the task?                  |
|Satisfaction      |Satisfaction is measured as a mix of a person's perception of the usefulness of the product, how much they trust it, the pleasure they get from using it, and the level of comfort they have. When you are designing the test tool, questions you might ask yourself include: <br> *When the person is using the software, how satisfied are they that the software contributes usefully to the task?* <br> *Do people trust the software to be producing accurate results?* <br>   *Does using the software give the person any pleasure?* <br>  *Is the person comfortable using the software?*   <br> Think about how you can provide testers with feedback within the tool that gives positive answers to these questions. |
|Freedom from risk | The testers and other stakeholders for the tool will face risks - domain, project, product, from the choice of using or not using the tool. This includes economic, health and safety, and environmental risks. Ask yourself, <br> *Will any stakeholder be more protected or less protected from economic damage?* <br>  *Will any stakeholder be more protected or less protected from damage to their health, safety, life?* <br>  *Will the environment (society, natural world, resource usage, sustainability be more protected or less protected by the use of this tool?* <br> Think about how the tool design will help to mitigate risk.|
|Context coverage  |The tool will be used in a range of contexts - It may not be possible to understand all the contexts completely, your stakeholders may not remember to tell you about all the contexts, but we should make some attempt to understand the possibilities. We also need to understand what level of flexibility is needed in those contexts and for the people using the tool. Ask yourself: <br> *Given everything above, have we thought not just what was explicitly told us, but also asked "where else?" "when else?"* <br> *How much can someone adapt the software to be suitable for themselves?* <br> Think about accessibility needs, people adapting the tool to new contexts, people learning and gaining confidence to use the tool in different ways. Conversely you may want to reduce flexibility if the context has domain risks and restrictions. |

Usability is a key contributor to QiU, and is multi-faceted. Breaking down the comments and concerns on usability we found that Operability is important to our participants, followed by learnability, being supported to meet their goals. Other attributes appeared less often. In the table below, you can see the usability sub attributes in order of their importance to our participants, together with a comment on design points:

**Table 3: Usability sub attributes**
| Attribute       |  Notes | 
|:----------------|:------|
|  Usability      | Over a third of all comments mention usability in a generic way. Usability contributes to the QiU attributes of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. To really understand it we need to break it down into its sub attributes, in the rest of the table below. |
| Operability     | Operability is about how well the tool supports people to move through their workflows in use, once then have learned how to use the tool. Around half of all usability comments were about operability, in particular about tools being superficially easy to learn, or having an attractive interface, but then not supporting long term use through the activities over time. That could be improved by thinking in particular about how maintainability of the tests and test artefacts is needed. Additionally, some participants reported that security blockers meant that the tool looked like it would be useful, but they had no access to it - security blocked operability. Operability is important for the effectiveness and efficiency of how people work, and is strongly supported by the other quality attributes. Workflow design is kep to supporting operability.|
| Learnability    | Learnability is about how easy it to learn to use the tool, it is a pre-requisite for the tool being operable; if you cannot learn it, you cannot use it. About a quarter of usability comments were about the learnability of tools. Some workshop participants discussed a trade-off with some tools being harder to learn, but then more useful, and other tools being easy to learn, but then less powerful. Some management level participants talked about there being no time for training courses, and needing to acquire tools that needed minimal learning. We also found people had strong - and widely differing views - about the media, methods, and purposes of learning - these are reflected in the heuristics.|
| User Goals      | The tool needs to support people to meet their goals. Just under a third of participants talked about how well - or otherwise - their tools supported them to meet their goals. |
| User interface aesthetics | The aesthetics of the user interface less mentioned, and then mainly as a source of irritation if a tool ``looked good but didn't meet expecctations. The aesthetics is imporant to support the operability and accessiblity of the tool.|                         | 
| Context         |  2.5%
| Satisfaction    |  1.8% 
| Accessibility   | 10 mentions, by 7 survey or workshop participants, strongly discussed by expert reviewer. Legal and moral implications|
| Appropriateness | 1           |                                        
| Recognizability | 1           |                                        
| User error protection |not mentioned but some participants talked about their fears when using the tools - of looking foolish, of loosing data, |



## Technical Quality Attributes
The technical attributes were mentioned often in the context of a problem that adversely affecting the overall user experience. The breakdown of technical attribute mentions in the data is in table 2. You can see that the attributes are in order of frequency, and the percentage given of the total number of technical comments and the percentage of all comments. Notice how low in the list functionality comes; people don't want more functionality; they want the overall experience to be better for the functionality supplied.
