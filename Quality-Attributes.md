# Quality Attributes

What makes a tool successful is definitely not just its functionality and technical attributes. Here’s some data from the research:

- 98% of the participants mentioned usability of the tools as a concern, issue or necessity with 511 mentions in all the data.
- 90% of the participants mentioned management and organizational issues as a concern, issue, and support being necessary with 377 mentions in all the data.
- all of the technical attributes of tools added together came to 466 mentons, by 91% of the particpants. That includes functionality.

Table 1: Themes: Organisational, Technical, Usability
Theme 	Participants 	Frequency
Organisational Management 	101 (90.9%) 	377
Technical Attributes 	102 (91.8%) 	466
Quality in Use / Usability 	109 (98.2%) 	511

The technical attributes were mentioned often in the context of a problem that adversely affecting the overall user experience. The breakdown is

## What are quality attributes?


## Quality in Use and the User Experience



Effectiveness – The accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. (no subcharacteristics)
Efficiency – The resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals. (no subcharacteristics)
Satisfaction – The degree to which user needs are satisfied when a product or system is used in a specified context of use.
Usefulness
Trust
Pleasure
Comfort
Freedom from risk – The degree to which a product or system mitigates the potential risk to economic status, human life, health, or the environment.
Economic risk mitigation
Health and safety risk mitigation
Environmental risk mitigation
Context coverage – The degree to which a product or system can be used with effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction in both specified contexts of use and in contexts beyond those initially explicitly identified.
Context completeness
Flexibility

## Product or Internal Quality Attributes




Functional suitability – The degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions.
Functional completeness
Functional correctness
Functional appropriateness
Performance efficiency – The performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated condition.
Time behavior
Resource utilization
Capacity
Compatibility – The degree to which a product, system or component can exchange information with other products, systems or components, and/or perform its required functions, while sharing the same hardware or software environment.
Co-existence
Interoperability
Usability – The degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Appropriateness recognizability
Learnability
Operability
User error protection
User interface aesthetics
Accessibility
Reliability – The degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time.
Maturity
Availability
Fault tolerance
Recoverability
Security – The degree to which a product or system protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization.
Confidentiality
Integrity
Non-repudiation
Accountability
Authenticity
Maintainability – The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers.
Modularity
Reusability
Analysability
Modifiability
Testability
Portability – The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a system, product or component can be transferred from one hardware, software or other operational or usage environment to another.
Adaptability
Installability
Replaceability
