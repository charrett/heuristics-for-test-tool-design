Heuristic Question: What workflows will the tool be part of?

## Explanation and subquestions

Workflows describe the steps people take to complete a series of tasks. Workflows describe the organizational/business tasks to be completed.
Think about: 
- Workflows transcend tools and individuals, weaving across and between teams and organizations. 
- Workflows include tasks that could be supported by a tool, and also tasks upstream and downstream from the tool.
- Workflows are described by experts in texts such as standards, syllabi, training courses, text books, blogs, etc. but those descriptions do not always reflect the reality of what people need to do.
- There will be an obvious set of activities within a workflow for an individual. The workflow will extend across a team, and to other teams within and possibly outside the organization. Workflows include information exchange and communication between people, data exchange between tools and systems, task handovers.

Research Point: We found that testers reported tools not supporting their workflow and feeling that unsuitable workflows had been imposed on their work. Workflows in tools did not always support preferred working practices, and sometimes were barriers to progress rather than enablers. Not having a choise can be a blocker, but sometimes it is essential. One of our participants said *"Some workflows are imposed as we don’t want the users to use their initiative and ‘improve’ the workflow but miss an important step (to someone else) they were unaware was important.  Other workflows do not follow preferred working practices due to technical/cost constraints. Workflow modelling is REALLY important in tool design and the workflows need to be modelled so that the tool designers are clear on what is optional and what is not, so that they can make compromises when implementing the workflow (e.g. based on tool costs, workflow time constraints, etc.)."* 

Key questions to ask yourself:
- What choices about their work practices and workflow contributions should individuals and teams have?
- Does the proposed tool cover part of a workflow, the whole of a workflow, or across more than one workflow?
- How complex are the workflows and do they include complexity-multipliers such as [large datasets, waiting times, institutional complexity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/complex-application-design-framework/)?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand and describe a workflow, you need to know the activities to be done, how they link together, who takes part, how workflows link together.
The test workflow and the development workflow will interact, but so might other organizational workflows. As part of those interactions, tools will need to interact.


Activities: Working with stakeholders and typical users for the tool
- Make a workflow diagram as a flowchart or a [wireflow diagram](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/)
- As testing activities are complex and iterative, consider [designing for a complex workflow with interruptions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-for-waits-and-interruptions/)
- [Journey Mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/) including [experience maps, customer journey maps and wmpathy maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-mapping-cheat-sheet/)
- [Service blueprint](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/) to get the interaction between the customer journey, the workflow and the technical flow
- Ask ["How might we? questions"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-might-we-questions/) to look for options.

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.
