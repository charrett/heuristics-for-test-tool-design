Heuristic Question: What workflows will the tool be part of?

## Explanation and subquestions

Workflows describe the steps people take to complete a series of tasks. Workflows describe the organizational/business tasks to be completed.
Think about: 
- Workflows transcend tools and individuals, weaving across and between teams and organizations. 
- Workflows include tasks that could be supported by a tool, and also tasks upstream and downstream from the tool.
- Workflows are described by experts in texts such as standards, syllabi, training courses, text books, blogs, etc. but those descriptions do not always reflect the reality of what people need to do.
- There will be an obvious set of activities within a workflow for an individual. The workflow will extend across a team, and to other teams within and possibly outside the organization. Workflows include information exchange and communication between people, data exchange between tools and systems, task handovers.

Research Point: We found that testers reported tools not supporting their workflow and feeling that unsuitable workflows had been imposed on their work. Workflows in tools did not always support preferred working practices, and sometimes were barriers to progress rather than enablers.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- What choices about their work practices and workflow contributions should individuals and teams have?
- Does the proposed tool cover part of a workflow, the whole of a workflow, or across more than one workflow? (TBD add link to detailed points about intersection of workflows)

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
To understand and describe a workflow, you need to know the activities to be done, how they link together, who takes part, how workflows link together.
TBD: note to mention  interaction of the test workflow (process) and the development workflow? And so interaction of the corresponding tools? NB – and other groups’ workflows


Activities: Working with stakeholders and typical users for the tool
- Make a workflow diagram as a flowchart or a wireflow diagram
- As testing activities are complex and iterative, consider designing for a complex workflow with interruptions
- Journey Mapping (have something here about experience map, customer journey maps and service blueprints)
- service blueprint to get the interaction between the customer journey, the workflow and the technical flow
- put in the rapid method as well as the full method
- TBD - how might we? questions

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the testers’ QiU/UX requirements within their context for the tool.
