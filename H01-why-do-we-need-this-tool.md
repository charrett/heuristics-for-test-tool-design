Theme: WHY?

Heuristic Question: Why do we need this tool?

## Explanation and subquestions

You've embarked on designing, building, or choosing a new tool to help support testing.  
Think about:

-	what problem the tool is intended to solve, and whether a tool is the best option for solving that problem. 
-	the people who are testing and the organization, and how their (different) goals need supporting. 
-	enablers and blockers to meeting those goals. 
-	both the testers and the organization have motivations to adopt or to resist a new tool, and these may be the same or may conflict. 

Research Point: In the research leading to the design of these heuristics, we found there are often conflicting goals and expectations for the tools, and different perceptions of what problems needed resolving to enable improvement in working practices. 

Key questions to ask yourself:
-	Is there a problem to solve?
-	Is it organizational or technical or something else?
- Can you design to increase productivity?
-	Can you design to reduce risk and increase value?
-	Can you design to improve the reach and certainty of people’s work?
-	Will this tool support what we are doing/want to achieve?
-	Does use of this tool cause any breach of ethical goals?
-	What is missing from the existing toolset?
-	Why does the tester need the tool?
-	Why does the organization want the tool?
-	Are there contradicting goals from different parts of the organization?
- What happens if (part of) the tool is not used?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand why you are building the tool, you need to consider goals for different stakeholders – including yourself.

You will need to iterate between “Why?” and “Who?” as you identify stakeholders and their goals.

Activities you might find useful to help you understand Why you need this tool  include:
-	[SWOT analysis](Technique-SWOT-Analysis.md)
-	Gap analysis
-	Contextual enquiry

Tip: Look at the Quality in Use attributes before you prioritize the product attributes, to make sure you focus designing for the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for the tool.
